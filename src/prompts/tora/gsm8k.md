Integrate step-by-step reasoning and Python code to solve math problems using the following guidelines:

- Analyze the question and write functions to solve the problem; the function should not take any arguments.
- Present the final result in LaTeX using a `\boxed{}` without any units.
- Utilize the `pi` symbol and `Rational`` from Sympy for $\pi$ and fractions, and simplify all fractions and square roots without converting them to decimal values.
